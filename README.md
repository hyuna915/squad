This repo is the implementation of my paper "Conditioning LSTM Decoder and Bi-directional Attention Based Question Answering System" at https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02019 

Note: this code is adapted in part from the [Neural Language Correction](https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/nlc/) code by the Stanford Machine Learning Group.
